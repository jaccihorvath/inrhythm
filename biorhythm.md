# Biorhythm Information

## History
It all started in the early 20th Century when an open minded psychology scientist from Austria, Dr. Herman Svoboda, recorded some observations of periodicity of different subjects. For example, he noticed that newborn babies refuse to accept food in cyclic patterns. That was the initiation. He extended his studies, which lead him to the discovery of distinct 23 and 28-day cycles. He published his results, with some rules how to predict the critical days in the cycles.

In the 1920's, Alfred Teltscher, a teacher and doctor of engineering, observed a cyclic fluctuation in the intellectual capabilities of his students in a definite 33 day cycle. Practically at the same time, in the United States, some other scientists reported on similar findings for the third, 33 day cycle. The rest is history. Today, more and more people experience lots of benefits by following their biorhythm charts, which is easy and simple to do.

## The Biorhythm Cycles
At their core, biorhythms are human existential cycles that regulate our health, emotions and intellect. There are three basic biorhythm cycles: a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle and a 33-day intellectual cycle. All three cycles begin at our birth and oscillate in a steady (sine wave) mode throughout the whole life. The biorhythm science calculates and shapes the cycles mathematically, so to predict a person's level of ability in each of these three aspects from day to day. Here are the cycles with their characteristics:

The Physical cycle regulates the strength, metabolic rate, sex drive, initiative, stamina, and eye and hand coordination. Your Physical cycle is situated in muscle tissues and fibers, affecting the general physical condition. It is considered the masculine cycle. For instance, from day 2 through day 11 your physical state is charging, so the physical work goes easier and you have high level of vitality and feel more vigorous, while the level of your endurance is higher. Critical points are Day 1 and 12. So, the three basic aspects of Physical cycle are:
* Strength
* Coordination
* Well being
The Emotional cycle regulates the nerves, moods, creativity and affection and is considered the feminine cycle because it last as long as the menstrual cycle (28 days) among all. The high end of the cycle is from Day 2 to Day 14 when a person is more optimistic and cheerful, while love, feelings, creativity and cooperation are strongly present. The low end of the cycle is from Day 16 to Day 28, when a person gets more irritable and negative and emotions incline towards a recuperative state. The intensity however depends on the person’s general character. Critical days are Day 1 and Day 15. Basic aspects:
* Sensitivity
* Mood
* Creativity
* Awareness
* Perception
The Intellectual cycle is the longer one (33 days) and regulates a person’s reasoning, logic, concentration, sense of direction, alertness, deduction, memory, and decision-making. It is considered that this cycle is less prominent than other two, but it still remains important as it originates from the brain cells and is affected by the secretions of the thyroid gland. The high end is from Day 2 to Day 16 when a person think more clearly and is capable of absorbing new ideas, which is great time for creative thinking and studying new ideas. The low phase is from Day 18 to Day 33 during which period these abilities are reduced. It is a good period for practice, study, and reflection. Critical days are Day 1 and Day 16 when one should escape making important decisions. So, basic aspects are:
* Logical analysis
* Analytical thinking
* Alertness
* Memory
* Communication

## Critical days
Critical days are the day a biorhytm crosses the boundary between positive and negative.

Regardless of the general belief that critical days are full of difficulty and danger, these are actually days of instability and flux. They aren’t days to be afraid of but to just be more careful and on guard. Also, critical days aren’t days when accidents occur, but period when a person can be more accident prone. By following your chart you can prevent any accident or mistake.

Some studies have shown that critical period last between 24 and 48 hours. It is important to know that for all cycles the first critical day starts 12 hours before the birth and lasts 12 hours after it. However, the reading of biorhythm cycles isn’t an exact science and the above is given only as a general guideline. Some analysts say that there is a 24 hour period of criticality for all cycles on Day 1 and for the sensitivity cycle on Day 14, but that is 48 hours centered on Day 11 of the Physical cycle and day 16 of the Intellectual cycle. 

## Calculate Your Biorhythm

Consult the charts for all three cycles, marked in different colors. These charts will show your biorhythm for a given day, a week, two weeks, 28 days or more. These are the lines of your life, since the day of your birth till present day or for the future, so you can predict your state for the next period and take appropriate actions
Locate the mid-point line on the chart. If a given cycle is above the mid-point line, it means that you are inside a positive period. If the line of the chart goes below the mid-point line, then you are inside the negative period. Different cycles can be in different period at the given moment
Notice the critical days. For example, when two or more lines of your cycles converge bellow the mid-point line; you need to take extra care and attention of your physical, emotional or intellectual wellbeing. Usually, these periods are a stressful time, but with knowing this, you can take some easy actions to improve your state
