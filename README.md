 # inRHYTHM


## Description
This project required designing and building a full-stack web application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. We followed the MVC design pattern using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app. Handlebars was used to generate the HTML. Travis CI was used to configure linting and for continuous integration. The project was then loaded to heroku for use with the JawsDB MySQL add-on as the database.
